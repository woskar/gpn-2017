# GPN 2017
Gulasch Programmier Nacht 

## GPN Badge
The badge has lots of sensors and was designed to receive push notifications during the event. The [official repo](https://github.com/entropia/gpn17-badge) has info for the setup of Arduino. Make sure to download all linked libraries and save them into the Arduino/libraries folder. On mac, thereâ€™s the driver Cp210x needed.

Here you can see my little hello world programm running :D
